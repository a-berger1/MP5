1--0--0--0--0--0--For The first level, you need one Transistor. Add it by clicking the "Add Transistor" button located in the "Gates" section of the "Toolbar". Drag the Transistor to the middle of the screen. Now we are going to wire up this Transistor and talk about how it works. In order to draw wires, the Lock Gates button must be engaged. 
2--0--0--0--0--0--Alright, for the next level You're going to need two Transistors. Add them Now. It's time to construct an "And Gate" out of nothing but two lowly Transistors. An "And Gate" only allows signal to pass through if both "Input Pins" (Located on the top in our case) are powered. Place two Transistors one above the other, with a little bit of space in between them, then lock the gates. Draw a wire connecting one of the source blocks to the top Transistor. This supplies power to our "And Gate." Next, connect the output of the top Transistor to the input of the lower Transistor. Now Connect the Output of the lower Transistor to the Ground Block. Notice how the Transistors do not light up, as they are not currently passing power through them. Power each "Switch Pin" with one of the Source Blocks. Notice how the Transistors light up? This indicates signal is passing through them.
